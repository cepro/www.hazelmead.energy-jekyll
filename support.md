          We're here to help every resident at Hazelmead, especially if you're facing difficulties or have special needs.
        </p>
        
        <h3>We can help if you're struggling</h3>
        
        <p>
          Life can be unpredictable. If you're having trouble understanding your bills, making payments, or you have medical equipment that needs electricity, we want to know so we can help.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Your energy bills at Hazelmead are already much lower than average homes thanks to our efficient buildings and renewable energy. But we know that even small bills can be challenging sometimes.
        </p>
        
        <h3>How we make things easier</h3>
        
        <p>
          <strong>If bills are confusing</strong>, we can provide them in alternative formats like printed bills or spoken bills. You can also nominate someone you trust to help manage your account.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <strong>If money is tight</strong>, we offer flat payment plans that spread costs evenly through the year, building up credit in summer to keep bills flat over winter. If your meter is about to run out, you can press a button on the meter for £30 emergency credit. We'll alert you when your credit drops below £30, and we can connect you with debt advice services if needed.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <strong>If you depend on electricity for medical reasons</strong>, we'll add you to our Priority Services Register. This means you'll get advance warning of any planned power cuts, a special phone number for emergencies, and we'll work to avoid any disconnection.
        </p>
